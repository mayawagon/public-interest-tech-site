                    <h1>Background</h1>
                    <p>NetGain is a philanthropic partnership committed to “influencing policy, markets, norms, and the design and use of the Internet and information technologies to make the world a better place.” In 2016, among other activities, NetGain seeks to develop a field scan that can provide a community-based perspective about how to grow the field of public interest technology. The goal is to identify people, groups, and networks who are already working in this space, including those who are not ‘the usual suspects’ in the civic technology world, and to learn from them: what their paths into the work have been; what they see as their greatest constraints; where they hit brick ceilings (resistance to change); and what’s most needed to grow and diversify the field.</p>

                    <p>With such a breadth of sites and networks for public interest technology, and with increasing commitments from funders and institutions to support this work, it’s imperative to map the field to better understand the various approaches, ideal outcomes, and needs of practitioners. What work is being done under the moniker of public interest technology, and what other frames do people use to talk about similar work? Where is this work situated? Who is doing this work? What are the key opportunities and barriers to diversifying and sustaining the field? How do we create a more expansive ecosystem, and escape the danger of an echo chamber limited to a relatively small cast of characters?</p>

                    <p>A community based field scan using participatory research methods, led by RAD and OTI, will help NetGain make informed choices about how to best support growth and inclusion in the emerging field of public interest technology.</p>
