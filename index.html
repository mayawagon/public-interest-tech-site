                    <h1>Background</h1>
                    <p>Research Action Design (RAD) and the Open Technology Institute (OTI), in partnership with organizations across the country, are conducting a community-led Technology for Social Justice Field Scan. The field scan seeks to identify and center diverse practitioners - people, groups, institutions, and networks - who are already working on technology for social good, identify challenges and opportunities that individuals and communities face in this work, examine vision, values, models and approaches to this work, and ultimately make recommendations  on how to best foster the growth of the field. This is a participatory research project; methods and analysis of findings will be guided by a diverse group of practitioners.</p> 

                    <p>This participatory research project is funded by the NetGain Partnership, a philanthropic partnership including Ford Foundation, Open Society Foundations, Knight Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, and the MacArthur Foundation. In 2016-2017, NetGain seeks to support a field scan that provides a community-based perspective on how to strengthen and build the field of technology for social good. The findings will help the NetGain Partnership make informed choices about how to best support growth and inclusion in the field.</p>

Flowing from that mission, our organization redefines the concept of “Internet Service Provider” in a collective and collaborative way. Like any democratic membership organization, we gather together each year to evaluate the past year’s experiences, plan the coming year’s work and elect a Leadership Committee to apply what we’ve decided. Like a coop, we pay dues, buy equipment and then we all use that equipment as we need to for websites, email, email lists, and just about everything else we do on the Internet.

                        <p>The Technology and Social Justice Field Scan is a participatory action research project intended to better understand the types of work currently being done with technology for social justice and the public interest, as well as the pathways people take into the work. The goal is to identify people, groups, and networks who are already working in this space, including those who are not ‘the usual suspects’ in the civic technology world, and to learn from them: what their paths into the work have been; what they see as their greatest constraints; where they hit brick ceilings (resistance to change); and what’s most needed to grow and diversify the field.</p>
